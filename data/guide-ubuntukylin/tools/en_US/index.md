#### Computer
The user can switch between four modes by holding down the "Win+P" on the keyboard.

**Application Scenario:**In the preparation phase of the meeting, what needs to be displayed in the computer needs to be taken out for a cursory examination, and when those who do not want to attend the meeting to see it, choose the computer only display, and all operations will only be displayed on the monitor, and the operations and contents of the computer will not be displayed on the projector.
#### Clone
If the user wants the computer and projector to be displayed at the same time, select Clone.

**Application Scenario:**The user needs the computer display to be synchronized with the projector display.
#### Extend
The extend mode identifies the computer monitor and projector screen as two monitors, allowing the user to have the computer and projector display different content when needed.

**Application Scenario:**Extend mode can be used when the user suddenly needs to use the computer to look up information during a meeting and does not want to interrupt the projector display, or when there is a temporary matter that needs to be handled urgently.
#### Output
The user wants to display only on the projector, select output.

**Application Scenario:**When the presenter leaves the computer, if someone accidentally touches the computer, the meeting may be interrupted. If the output mode is selected, the computer screen is completely blacked out, which is more power-saving than the copy and expand mode.
