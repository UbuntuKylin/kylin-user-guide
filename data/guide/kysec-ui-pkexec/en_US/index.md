# Kylin Security Manager Tools
## Overview
Kylin Security Manager Tools is developed to protect the integrality of system applications and files, and make sure the system is safe and reliable. It supports to control the execution rights of each application, protect system files change and kernel driver modules uninstallation. 

There are the security modes: Strict, Warning, Record. The main interface as shown in Fig 1.

## Basic Function
### Security Modes
**Strict Mode**

- The procedures and dynamic libraries without safety certification will be prevented from executing automatically.

- Prevent users from modifying, deleting or renaming protected files.

- Prevent users from loading kernel driver modules without safety certification.

**Record Mode**

It's called "Maintenance Mode" also.

System won't prevent or prompt any opearation without authentication and just record them in system log.

<br>

Only administrators have rights to set and configure the security mode by kylin security manager.

Ordinary users only can view the running status and configurations of security modes. 

When it's 3-adm mode, only security administrators can configure the security mode.

- Open: The new creation of executable files, scripts and sharing libraries (generated by copying, building and downloading from network) can't run directly. It has to get the certification or be added to the white list.

- Close: The new creation of executable files, scripts and sharing libraries can run directly, and any opearation for the white list is forbidden.
