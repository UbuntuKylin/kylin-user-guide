### Security Modes
**Strict Mode**

- The procedures and dynamic libraries without safety certification will be prevented from executing automatically.

- Prevent users from modifying, deleting or renaming protected files.

- Prevent users from loading kernel driver modules without safety certification.

- Open: The new creation of executable files, scripts and sharing libraries (generated by copying, building and downloading from network) can't run directly. It has to get the certification or be added to the white list.

- Close: The new creation of executable files, scripts and sharing libraries can run directly, and any opearation for the white list is forbidden.
