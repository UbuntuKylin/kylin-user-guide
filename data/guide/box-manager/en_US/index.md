Kylin Box-manager can realize the security protection and sharing of user's private data by the combination of isolation and hiding, encryption protection and sharing authorization. The features as shown below:

- Newly created personal directories (i.e. BOX, BOX directories) are visible only to the user himself and not to other users.

- Users can authorize other users to access private box with read-only or read-write permission, and access the box shared by other users.

- Users can set encryption for private box. Therefor other users need to have sharing authorization and password authentication to access encrypted box.

- Encrypted box needs to be used after mounting. The mounted box cannot be deleted or renamed; Password setting and sharing setting are not allowed, either. If the changes above are necessary, the box should be umount first.
